## Description 
This is a Progressive web application that was built with React using a test-driven and behavior driven development approach .  It consists of a Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events, and a serverless function hosted by AWS.  
Users can select a city from a list of suggestions or see all cities, and they can also choose the number of events to see.  It also includes a scatter plot and pie chart.

## Quick Start 🚀

App can be viewed on [GitHub Pages](https://drxl95.github.io/meet/).
To run it locally yourself, clone the repository, and complete the following steps:

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start application with npm and run in browser

_By default the app will run a local server on port: 3000_

```bash
npm run start
```

### Running application tests

# FEATURE 1: Filter Events By City
As a user, I should be able to filter the events by city.

## Scenario 1: When user hasn’t searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities.
- Given: user hasn’t searched for any city
- When: the user opens the app
- Then: the user should see a list of all upcoming events

## Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city.
 - Given: the main page is open
 - When: user starts typing in the city textbox
 - Then: the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed

## Scenario 3:  User can select a city from the suggested list.
 - Given: the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox
 - And the list of suggested cities is showing
 - When: the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list
 - Then: their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”)
 - And the list of suggestions should disappear.
 - And the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.


# FEATURE 2: Show/Hide an Event's Details
As a user, I should be able to show/hide the details of an event.

 # FEATURE 3: Specify Number of Events
 As a user, I should be able to speciy a certain number of events. so that I can see as many/little as I want

 - Given: user is on app
 - When: user sees elements and hasn't typed in a number

 ## Scenario 2: User can change the number of events the way they want to see
 - Given: user is on app
 - When: user specifies the number of events they want to see
 - Then: the user sees the specified number of events they want to see



 # FEATURE 4: Use the App When Offline
 As a user, I should be able to use the app to some extent when I am offline, so that I can see events without internet connection

 ## Scenario 1: Show cached data when there's no internet connection
- Given: user has no internet connection and is on the app
- When: user wants to see events
- Then: the user will be able to see catched events (accessed when user had internet)

- Given: user has no internet connection
- When: user tries to change the settings
- Then: user gets error message



# FEATURE 5: DATA VISUALIZATION
As a user, I should be able to view a chart showing upcoming events in each city, so I can see the upcoming events in the city

## Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
